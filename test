Summary:
Over the past year, I actively contributed to various components, including Typologies, Matching Engine, and Reconciliation Reports, which have significantly advanced our team's and the company's goals. In Typologies, I addressed defects, enhancements, and took responsibility for managing the typology library, resolving production issues with minimal impact, and optimizing DOB and location mismatch logic. In the Matching Engine, I developed a Custom Scoring algorithm, introduced features like out-of-order shingles and consistent scoring for Chinese names, and made enhancements to the lucene-searcher component. Additionally, I worked on the lucene-indexer component to index new watchlists. In the Reconciliation Reports, I participated in design discussions, established database connections, and worked on both the front-end and back-end of the UI component.

Furthermore, I proactively engaged in discussions to enhance our product's efficiency. For Searcher 2.0, I initiated a fool-proof search engine to address alert configuration issues, presenting the prototype to higher management. In Custom Scoring and ACL enhancements, I proposed a graph-based algorithm to pick the best name and deployed features like out-of-order shingles and word type-specific scoring. I collaborated with the business team to implement ACL logic for nationality fields. In Reconciliation Report enhancements, I improved the comparison data analysis, implemented automations, and facilitated data extraction for better matching.

Lastly, I actively participated in DEI initiatives by engaging in events like the AWS Deepracer competition, where I stood among the top participants and gained valuable insights into machine learning. I also participated in the SEP-a-thon hackathon, building a prototype for tracking micro service calls. Additionally, I contributed to mentoring SEPs of the 2023 batch by providing knowledge transfer sessions on various components, further supporting our company's growth and development.





Section 1: Deliver the goals of your team, business/ function and the company

Over the past year, I got opportunity to work in many components including typologies, matching engine, reconciliation reports etc.

Typologies:

Started to work on typologies defects and enhancements including the issues in combination typologies and fuzzy typologies.
Over the past few months, took the responsibility of looking over the typology library and its deployments.
Worked on the production issue caused due to nationality field. As part of the defect, had to go through the codebase of lucene-searcher, typologies and ACL to understand the root cause and delivered a fix with minimal impact on other components. Also got involved in extensive testing of the fix before deploying the code in production.
Made changes for DOB mismatch and location mismatch in guardrails and ACL logic which helped business filter out unwanted matches and reduce the alert count.
Matching Engine:

Over the past year, I was involved in development of the Custom scoring algorithm and constantly deploying newer versions according to the changing requirements from the business team.
Inclusion of out-of-order shingle for scoring, generating different scores based on the word type, consistent scoring for Chinese names are few of the major features in custom scoring that I worked on.
Made few enhancements in lucene-searcher component which include addition of nationality address field in matching items, fixing the issue of sanctions name used for screening among others.
Started working on lucene-indexer component to index few new watchlists.
Reconciliation reports:

I actively contributed in development of the reconciliation reports component right from the design to deployment in production environment.
Worked on various tech-stack including AWS glue job, lambda functions, terraform scripts and got to learn Scala programming language.
Deployed components in both GKP (Java based) and EKS (Python based) and was successful in establishing database connection in python EKS.
I was involved in the design discussion of the alert suppression component which involved in creation of the shards for the searcher and having an architecture similar to master-slave. Also worked on base code setup of alert-suppression-master component.
Got an opportunity to work on both front-end and back-end of the UI component, exposing me to different components used in our application.

Section 2: Identify and deliver appropriate solutions that address the needs of clients / customers/ stakeholders
In the last one year, I was pro-actively involved in discussions to make the product more efficient and effective.

Searcher 2.0:

We observed that the existing solution may not work with configurations for sanctions.
Hence we ideated a fool-proof search engine which does not miss any alert.
Started working on the prototype and delivered a presentation to the higher management convincing them on the requirement and efficacy of the solution proposed.
Custom Scoring and ACL enhancements:

In order to achieve good speed for the system, we observed it necessary to pick the best name before the typologies.
Hence, we ideated on using a graph-based algorithm to pick the best name.
We proposed enhancements in the custom scoring logic to pick an accurate best name, by introducing new features like incorporation of out-of-order-shingles and word type specific score. Was successful in deploying these features post business validations.
Collaborated with the business team in defining and implementing the ACL logic for nationality field and reduce the impact on other components and existing alerts.
Reconciliation report enhancements:

I was involved in comprehensive analysis of the comparison data and made enhancements to help the business team deliver validations quickly.
I implemented few automations (based on typology results) in the analysis of the report helping the business team deliver the validations quicker.
Worked on extracting the entity-type data to help business filter out unwanted matches easily.

Section 3: Other Activities 
Over the past one year, I was involved in various events in support of firms DEI initiatives including AWS Deepracer and SEP events.

AWS Deepracer:

Participated in Hyderabad Tech center's Deepracer event, where around 400 people actively participated.
Stood overall 2nd in the final physical race in Hyderabad.
Got an opportunity to participate in JPMC Global finals representing Hyderabad Tech center.
Stood among the few teams to complete the track in JPMC global finals.
This experience helped me get a working knowledge on machine learning and reinforcement learning.
SEP-a-thon:

Participated in an overnight hackathon conducted by the SEP program.
Actively worked on building prototype for tracking micro service calls in EKS.
Got an experience on AWS infrastructure and existing solutions like Jaeger.
Mentoring:

Worked along with SEPs of 2023 batch of CLS, to get them involved in reconciliation reports and typology components through few KT sessions.
Recently, hosted few KT sessions to the new SEPs on matching engine and started guiding them to work on the matching engine.
